# purescript-aff-sockets

Functions to manage TCP Sockets based on the Node JS Net module in Aff.

## Getting started

The tests do not compile in this version.

The source compiles with Purescript version 14.9 and the project is now set up with Spago.

This module is no longer used in Perspectives Core.

[See the tests](https://github.com/joopringelberg/purescript-aff-sockets/tree/master/test/) for a simple echo server and a Telnet-like client.
